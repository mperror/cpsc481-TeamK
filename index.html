            First and foremost our team goal is to get an A+ on this project. But more than that, we hope that by the
            end of the project we will have created an intuitive and effective UI design that we can all be proud of and
            include in a portfolio for prospective future employers. We also want to become more familiar with various
            prototyping tools, learn new skills which we can take beyond the course and obtain a stronger knowledge of
            user-centered design concepts and practises.

		<h3>1. Map Activity and Events Recommender</h3>
		
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> With many events happening around the city, it is often challenging to track and
						be aware of the available opportunities. Currently, people will learn about events
						through certain social media accounts, but this information is spread out and not
						consolidated anywhere. This is challenging when someone is either travelling to
						a new city looking for something to do, or is a current resident who is trying to
						learn about local events that they can attend, meet new people, and have fun at.
						notifications can alert the user anytime of events happening around them.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> As many organizations put great efforts into hosting events that help build a
						stronger sense of community, their work is often unnoticed as many people may
						be too busy to learn about what is happening around them in the city. This is a
						missed opportunity for people to come together to socialize and learn about
						different cultures and ways of life.<br>
						Many people in our society end up neglecting their social life due to work and
						other obligations. They forget to socialize and build meaningful relationships with
						others in their community, which is key to living a balanced, connected, happy,
						and healthy life.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A platform that consolidates all the events happening in a city and makes
						personalized recommendations to the user and notifies them of opportunities.
						This way, the problem of sparse and limited information can be resolved and
						people would have greater knowledge about events that they would be interested
						in attending. This can also help event hosters see more engagement and
						ultimately help build a stronger community.
					</P>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p>	This would be in the form of a mobile application as push notifications can<br>
						alert the user anytime of events happening around them.
					</p>

		<h3>2. Fitness Planner App (Smart notification and planning system)</h3>
		
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> When people begin pursuing fitness goals they can face a variety of challenges:
						People may not know what exercises will be best to achieve their fitness goals,
						have difficulty learning the motions of new exercises, have trouble staying
						committed to their workout schedule, and may not have the same equipment
						availability as others. Although a personal trainer helps solve a few of these
						problems, it can still be too expensive for many individuals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> Physical fitness can be a very important tool as it helps lead to a healthier
						lifestyle and improve mental and physical well-being. Moreover a lack of physical
						fitness may lead to a higher risk of long term health issues that could prevent the
						user from living their desired life.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A mobile fitness app which will ask the user what their fitness goals
						and preferences are so it can construct a fitness plan. This plan will help achieve their
						goals based on things like availability, age, current fitness level, and equipment
						availability. The app would help individuals keep track of their fitness goals and
						also have the information that they need to achieve their goals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application will give notifications to help the user stay motivated and on
						track. A mobile application would be accessible anywhere and anytime so a user
						can get a workout whenever convenient for them, rather than being limited 
						to working at home or at the gym.
					</p>

		<h3>3. Health Tracking App (Hydration, heart rate, food intake, and other health metrics)</h3>
	
		<div class="prettyContainer">
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Problem:</h4>
					<p> As people begin to live busier lives, it can be easy to forget about taking care of
						one’s well-being. Many individuals find it hard to monitor their health metrics and
						lifestyle with simple tasks such as forgetting to drink the necessary amount of
						water per day, getting the proper nutrients and vitamins, or failing to realize if vital
						organ functions are working correctly. The challenge here is to provide
						easy-to-understand health information so a user can take proactive approaches
						to living a healthier life.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Importance:</h4>
					<p> Fitness is crucial when it comes to taking care of health and avoiding illnesses or
						diseases. If individuals are unable to identify their health information, they may
						not be sure about their current fitness levels which could cause them to miss
						information that could have allowed them to take action sooner.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="floatBox">
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>Potential Solution:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application could help those who are trying to keep their fitness metrics
						in check. Through interactive notifications, users can track if they are hydrated,
						eating the right amount, and moving enough in their day-to-day life. The health
						tracking app could gather and keep track of information about the user to
						personalize health plans. When someone doesn’t have good physical health,
						it can trickle down to other vital components such as mental health, which can
						affect the user’s overall life.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="floatText">
					<h4>System Type:</h4>
					<p> A mobile application will be used to provide quick and easy recommendations to
						enhance the user’s wellbeing.
